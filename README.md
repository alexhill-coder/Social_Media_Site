## How To Use

<p align="center">
To use the app start by registering your details (does not have to be personnel/real details) in the registration form which is accessed by the link under 
the login form. If there are any issues the form will alert you and let you know if the details were registered correctly.

</p>

<p align="center">
 Once on the main screen you can view information such as your inputted name and how many posts/likes you have made. You'll also have the ability to post comments and have them be 
 viewed and commented on by yourself or any of your friends. This can be done by clicking on the post area.

</p>

This is still a work in progress so to view posts from other accounts you have to insert them directly via the database.
